# Medical Record Management System (MRMS).

MRMS provides a platform to securely store everyoneâ€™s medical records and retrieve it quickly and easily,  
thereby eliminating the need to carry physical documents in person.

It provides doctors, access to a patients medical history, in times of emergencies, according to which the patient  
can be given appropriate treatment. This elimiates the risk of prescribing the wrong type of medication or treatment  
to the patient in times when the patient is unable to state their medical history.
